# Supametrics: A Unified Analytics Platform ðŸš€

Supametrics is a robust, developer-focused analytics platform designed to provide insightful data with a minimal, premium interface. This monorepo project combines a powerful Next.js dashboard, a high-performance Hono (TypeScript) API for user and project management, and an efficient Go Fiber API for real-time analytics ingestion. It's built for precision, selfhosting and scalability, empowering developers to understand their applications' usage patterns.

## Features

- **Real-time Analytics Ingestion**: Efficiently logs and tracks analytics events via a dedicated Go Fiber API, secured by public API keys.
- **Comprehensive User & Project Management**: Manage users, create and organize projects, and oversee teams through a robust Hono (TypeScript) API.
- **Secure Authentication & Authorization**: Implements email/password authentication, supports OAuth (Google, GitHub), and includes session management with JWT and refresh tokens.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defines granular permissions for users (`user`, `admin`, `superadmin`), teams (`owner`, `member`, `viewer`), and projects (`admin`, `editor`, `viewer`).
- **API Key Management**: Generate and rotate public and secret API keys for secure data ingestion and authorized analytics retrieval.
- **Intelligent Rate Limiting & Quotas**: Protects against abuse and enforces plan-based usage limits using Redis for caching and rate-limiting.
- **Dynamic Reporting**: Generate and manage various reports on project analytics data through a dedicated API.
- **Modern Interactive Dashboard**: A sleek Next.js dashboard provides a visually appealing and highly responsive interface for data visualization, powered by Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Framer Motion.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Supametrics project locally.

### Installation

To get started, first clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supametrics/supametrics.git
cd supametrics
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Each application in the monorepo requires specific environment variables. Create `.env.local` files in the respective directories (`apps/dashboard/`, `apps/hono-api/`, `apps/go-server/`) based on their `.env.example` templates.

#### `apps/hono-api/.env.local`

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-client-secret
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your-github-client-id
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-client-secret
BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your-randomly-generated-secret
AUTH_SECRET=your-auth-secret
REDIS_URL=your-upstash-redis-url
TRUSTED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3002
```

#### `apps/go-server/.env.local`

```
DB_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/database # Must be the same as hono-api
REDIS_URL=your-upstash-redis-url
AI_REPORT_PROMPT="Your AI prompt for report generation"
```

#### `apps/dashboard/.env.local`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3004
```

### Database Setup

The Hono API uses Drizzle ORM for PostgreSQL. Run migrations to set up your database schema:

1.  Navigate to the `hono-api` directory:
    ```bash
    cd apps/hono-api
    ```
2.  Run Drizzle migrations (ensure your `DATABASE_URL` is set in `.env.local`):
    ```bash
    npx drizzle-kit push:pg
    ```
    (Note: If `drizzle-kit` is not globally installed, use `npx drizzle-kit` or install it with `npm install -g drizzle-kit`)

### Running Services

Supametrics is a monorepo managed with Turborepo. You can run all services concurrently or individually.

1.  **Start the Hono API (TypeScript Backend)**:

    ```bash
    npm run dev --filter=hono-api
    # Or navigate to apps/hono-api and run:
    # tsx watch src/index.ts
    ```

    The Hono API will run on `http://localhost:3004`.

2.  **Start the Go Server (Analytics Ingestion Backend)**:

    ```bash
    cd apps/go-server
    go run main.go
    ```

    The Go server will run on `http://localhost:3005`.

3.  **Start the Next.js Dashboard (Frontend)**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev --filter=dashboard
    # Or navigate to apps/dashboard and run:
    # next dev --port 3002 --turbopack
    ```
    The Next.js dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:3002`.

## Usage

Once all services are running, you can interact with the platform:

### Dashboard Access

Navigate to `http://localhost:3002` in your web browser. You can:

- **Sign Up / Log In**: Create a new account or log in using email/password or OAuth (if configured).
- **Manage Projects**: Create new projects, view existing ones, manage API keys, and invite team members.
- **View Analytics**: Explore overview statistics, project-specific analytics, and generated reports. The dashboard provides a visual representation of the data ingested by the Go analytics server.

### API Reference

Supametrics exposes two distinct API services: the main Hono API for core functionalities and the Go Fiber API for high-volume analytics ingestion.

#### Base URL

- **Hono API**: `http://localhost:3004/api/v1`
- **Go Fiber API**: `http://localhost:3005/api/v1`
