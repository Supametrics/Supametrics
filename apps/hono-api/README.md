# Supametrics API ðŸš€

## Overview

This project is a high-performance backend API built with Hono and TypeScript, designed to provide comprehensive analytics, user, team, and project management. It leverages Drizzle ORM for type-safe interaction with a PostgreSQL database (Neon) and utilizes Redis for robust caching and rate limiting, ensuring efficient and scalable operations.

## Features

- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user authentication via email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub) with robust session management and role-based access control (RBAC).
- **User & Profile Management**: APIs for creating, managing, and updating user profiles, including subscription types and email verification status.
- **Team Management**: Functionality to create and manage teams, including inviting members with specific roles (owner, member, viewer).
- **Project Management**: Comprehensive APIs for creating, listing, updating, and deleting projects, supporting both personal and team-based ownership.
- **API Key Management**: Secure generation, rotation, and revocation of API keys for each project to control external access.
- **Real-time Analytics Collection**: Capture and aggregate various analytics events (page views, visitor IDs, UTM parameters, device info) for projects.
- **Data Reporting**: Generate and retrieve custom reports based on collected analytics data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implements Redis-backed rate limiting to protect API endpoints from abuse and ensure service stability.
- **Scalable Data Storage**: Utilizes a PostgreSQL database (Neon Serverless) for reliable and scalable data persistence.
- **Efficient Caching**: Integrates Redis for high-speed data caching and transient storage for sessions and rate limiting.

## Usage

To start the Supametrics API server:

1.  **Set up Environment Variables**: Populate your `.env` file with the required variables as detailed in the "Environment Variables" section.
2.  **Run Development Server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command uses `tsx` to watch for changes and restart the server automatically.
3.  **Build and Start for Production**:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    npm run start
    ```
    `npm run build` compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript, and `npm run start` runs the compiled application.

The API will be available at `http://localhost:3004`. Use the documented endpoints with appropriate authentication (session cookies/tokens handled by `better-auth`) to interact with the system. For integrating analytics into your applications, use the generated project API keys for secure data submission.
